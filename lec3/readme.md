# Understanding the react flow and structure 

- compare create-react and vite  ; once understood the flow you will be able to use any library 
- Goal is to understand how React gets injected to HTML (Foundation)
- point and time of injection

## Let's start
- basically foundational rule says; we have to inject javascript using `<script>` tag  , no exception 

## 01basicreact app

### Structure 

- _nodemodules_ folder have the dependencies needed
- _.gitignore_ ; tells which files to ignore like _nodemodules_ folder because that can be installed easily using `npm i`
- _package-lock.json_ : fix/locks the version of dependencies _package.json_
- _README.md_ : introductory file
- _public_ folder have files that are not much of importance 
  - _manifest.json_ : meta tags are looked from here , when web app works on the mobile device
  - only file important is **_index.html_** 
    - Also called "SIngle Page Application" or SPA because all the work is done here . 
      - Foundation is same : images , elements tags , sliders all are brought by DOM 
      - with DOM manipulation , we move from one page to other
    - This is the main page , which is loaded

### Working on files

- Go to **_index.html_** file and clean all the comments 
and close the head tag too 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>...
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>

```

- Breaking down , part by part 
  - `<noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>` : says that if JS is not enabled in the browser  ; enable it 
  - ```<div id="root"></div>``` : it is the only thing 

- Go to **_src/iindex.js_** file 
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

```
- breaking line by line 
  - line 1 & 2 depicts the library needed to manipulate the DOM of web 
    - react is a core 
    - react-dom is an implemention for web
  - line 4 ; DOM : a tree structure 
    - react creates a virtual DOM ; browser have its own main DOM . and comparision is there and changes the elements needed
    - method `createRoot` which takes an id , its just basic JS 
    - ```<div id="root"></div>``` : get back to _index.html_ ; id can have any name ; no rules 
    - our whole application will load at this div
    - refernce to all this is stored in a variable `root` 
  - line 5 ; Html main browser does what ? it renders the html
    - here is the same implemention 
    - we render here `<App/>`
    - There was tag like that in html ; YES!! it is a custom tag ; This is the power of react : JSX ; we can render html tags through javascript
    - `<React.StrictMode>`: it is just a property of react ; app can render without it too
    - it is for optimization and safe mode for development ; have advantages but it is  not complusory 
  - From does this App come from 
    - Yes! line 3 
    - visit _App.js_ file 
    - App() is a function there which return html 
    - Intersting !! React says , take a function ; return html and that html is rendered 
    - We got Programming capabilities in hmtl . Wow
  - Did we load JS, NO then How ?
     - Go to _package.josn_ and check `"react-scripts": "5.0.1",` ; this helps in loading Js in html ; need Prof
     - run the project and check the page source you will see this:- `  <script defer src="/static/js/bundle.js"></script>`
     - inspect in browser too  and see the scripts added 


## 01basicreact vs 01vitereact

- Go to _package.json_ see , there are no web scripts so how the React file is injected? Let's Analyse
   - First: _index.html_ is in root folder i.e outside of public folder
   - Open _index.html_ ; see they have directly loaded 
   - Loaded like classical JS instead of that many scripts
   ```html
     <body style="background-color: rgb(5, 4, 45);">
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
   ```
- compare _main.jsx_ of vite and _index.js_ of basicreact 
  - differnce is that  _main.jsx_ of vite  is not taking refernce to DOM ; rest working is same 


### Make more like `<App/>` in **vite**

- Let's work on **01vitereact** ;
- run the app first `npm run dev`
-$ProtipðŸ’¡$: .jsx extension is for  making components
- Make a new file _chai.js_ in **src** folder and write
```javascript
function chai() {
    return (
        <h2>Chai</h2>
    )
}

export default chai 
``` 
- and in _App.jsx_ write
```javascript
import chai from './chai.jsx'
function App() {
  return (
    <chai/>
  )
}
export default App
```

- Error encountered
  -  Pre-transform error: Failed to parse source for import analysis because the content contains invalid JS syntax. If you are using JSX, make sure to name the file with the .jsx or .tsx extension.
- How to resolve ; rename the _chai.js_ to _chai.jsx_
  - Now no error but no output on page ;
  - go to inspect->console
  - react-dom.development.js:86  Warning: The tag `<chai>` is unrecognized in this browser. If you meant to render a React component, start its name with an uppercase letter.
    at chai
    at App
  - These are Best Practices
- After changes 
 - _App.jsx_ 
```javascript
import Chai from './chai.jsx'
function App() {
  return (
    <Chai/>
  )
}
export default App
``` 
   - _chai.jsx_
```javascript
function Chai() {
    return (
        <h2>Chai is here</h2>
    )
}
export default Chai 
```

- It will work fine now

### Modifications in _App.jsx_
- try writing this
```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <Chai/>
  )
```
- Error: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag. Did you want a JSX fragment <>...</>? (5:4)
  - It means ; we have to return only single element 
  - Solution is wrapping all the components / elements in a `<div></div>` tag 
  - Because this was a common issue so they introduced : fragment <>...</>
- Now code will look like ; by these multiple elements are returned as a single component
```javascript
function App() {
   return (
    <>
    <Chai/>
    <h1>yo</h1>
    <p>Tomato is Red</p>
    </>
  )
  )
```

### Make more like `<App/>` in **Basic React**
- Try the same things here , and observe the differnce 
 - it also restricts the use of intial lowercase
 - but it works with .js extension and .jsx both 
$ProtipðŸ’¡$: Best Practices , the intials of file like _App.jsx_ or _Chai.jsx_ should be capital
